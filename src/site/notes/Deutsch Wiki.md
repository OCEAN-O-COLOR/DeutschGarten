### <font size=6><u>Introduction</u></font>

<font size=5>*Hey there! This is Daiz Damien. I have been learning the German language for the past few days. During this time, I discovered Obsidian, a note-taking app. Writing was never my obsession, but after discovering Obsidian, I found myself more excited about writing things others would love to read.  ![Pasted image 20231121222838.png|right|200](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020231121222838.png)
This digital garden is my humble attempt to share the things I have learned in class with those who might be interested in learning the language. This is a list of things I have covered, but I expect it to grow as time passes. Click on the links in the wiki to reach your objective. Alles Gute zum Deutschlernen!*ðŸ™‚

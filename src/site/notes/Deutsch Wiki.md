### <font size=6><u>Introduction</u></font>

<font size=5>*Hey there!This is Daiz Damien. I am learning German language for the past few days. During this time period, I discovered Obisidian a note taking app. Writing was never my obsession but after discovering Obi, I was more or less excited about writing things others would love to read. This Digital garden is my humble attempt to share the things I learned in the class with those who might interested in learning the language. It is far from perfect but hey, it is atleast honest work. This is a small wiki of things I have covered but expect it to grow as time passes. Click on the links in the wiki to reach your objective. Alles gute zum Deutschlernen* ðŸ™‚</font>

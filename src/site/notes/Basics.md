The basic of learning a language is understanding how to use and pronounce alphabets and count numbers. English being a germanic language shares most of the alphabets with some exceptions. Eventhough letters are the same, the pronounciation differs widely between the languages. To get a steady grip of german alphabets, it is recommended to repeat the alphabets and numbers in the mind often.
